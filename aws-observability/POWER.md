## Configuration

After installing this power, update the MCP server configuration with your AWS profile and region:

1. Open Kiro Settings → MCP Servers (or edit `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`)
2. Find the `awslabs.cloudwatch-mcp-server` entry
3. Update the `env` section:

```json
"env": {
  "AWS_PROFILE": "your-profile-name",  // ← Change to your AWS profile
  "AWS_REGION": "us-east-1",           // ← Change to your region
  "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
}
```

**Default:** Uses `default` AWS profile and `us-east-1` region.

## Log Query Patterns

The CloudWatch MCP server uses CloudWatch Logs Insights query syntax via the `execute_log_insights_query` tool. It also provides `analyze_log_group` for automated pattern and anomaly detection.

### Basic Error Search

```
fields @timestamp, @message, @logStream, level
| filter level = "ERROR"
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 100
```

### Performance Analysis with Aggregations

```
stats count() as requestCount,
      avg(duration) as avgDuration,
      pct(duration, 95) as p95Duration,
      pct(duration, 99) as p99Duration
by endpoint
| filter requestCount > 10
| sort p95Duration desc
```

### JSON Field Extraction

```
fields @timestamp, @message
| parse @message '{"userId": "*", "action": "*"}' as userId, action
| stats count() as actionCount by userId, action
| sort actionCount desc
| limit 100
```

### Error Rate Over Time

```
stats count() as total,
      sum(statusCode >= 500) as errors,
      (sum(statusCode >= 500) / count()) * 100 as errorRate
by bin(5m) as timeWindow
| sort timeWindow
```

### Multi-Log-Group Query

Use the `log_group_identifiers` parameter to query across multiple log groups:
```
fields @timestamp, @message, @logStream
| filter @message like /ERROR|Exception/
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 50
```

## Best Practices

### CloudWatch Logs
1. Always include timestamp filters to minimize scan volume
2. Use specific log groups to improve query performance
3. Use LIMIT to prevent overwhelming result sets
4. Use `analyze_log_group` for automated pattern and anomaly detection
5. Test queries on small time windows first
6. Leverage `stats` and `parse` commands for structured analysis

### CloudWatch Metrics & Alarms
1. Use appropriate statistics for different metric types:
   - `Sum` for count metrics (Errors, Invocations)
   - `Average` for utilization metrics (CPUUtilization)
   - Percentiles (p95, p99) for latency metrics
2. Leverage Metrics Insights for complex queries
3. Use recommended alarm configurations as starting points
4. Monitor alarm history to tune thresholds

### Application Signals
1. Instrument applications with AWS X-Ray SDK
2. Define meaningful service names with environment prefixes
3. Set realistic SLOs aligned with business requirements
4. Use adaptive sampling for high-volume services
5. Always capture error traces for debugging

### CloudTrail
1. Enable CloudTrail in all regions
2. **Consider CloudTrail Lake** for long-term retention and SQL-based analysis
3. Integrate with CloudWatch Logs for real-time analysis and alerting
4. Set up alerts for critical security events
5. Regular audit log reviews
6. Use the data source priority approach for efficient querying

## Integration Patterns

### Logs + Metrics + Traces
```
# Correlate logs with Application Signals traces
fields @timestamp, requestId, traceId, @message, duration, statusCode
| filter traceId like /./
| filter duration > 1000
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 50
```

### CloudTrail + Logs
```
# Find errors correlated with recent changes
fields @timestamp, @message, errorType, requestId
| filter level = "ERROR"
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 50
```
Then cross-reference timestamps with CloudTrail events using the data source priority:
1. Query CloudTrail Lake event data store (if available)
2. Query CloudWatch Logs for CloudTrail events (if integrated)
3. Use `lookup_events` API (fallback)

This helps identify configuration changes that may have caused errors.

### Metrics + Cost
Use CloudWatch Metrics to identify high-utilization resources, then analyze their costs in Cost Explorer to find optimization opportunities.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Insufficient permissions" errors**
   - Verify IAM policies include all required actions
   - Check resource-based policies on log groups
   - Ensure Cost Explorer is enabled in your account

2. **"Query timeout" errors**
   - Reduce time range in queries
   - Use more specific filters
   - Query fewer log groups at once

3. **"No results found"**
   - Verify log group names and ARNs are correct
   - Check time range matches your data
   - Ensure field names are case-sensitive correct

4. **MCP server connection issues**
   - Verify uvx is installed: `pip install uv`
   - Check AWS credentials: `aws sts get-caller-identity`
   - Review MCP server logs (set FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG)
